### File System

```
1) ~ refers to the current user's home directory.
      usage : cd ~/Desktop

2) handling spaces in paths: 

     -- Path names can contain almost any character, but some characters, such as space, must be escaped in most software, usually 
       by enclosing the name in quotation marks.
       
       usage : "~/Examples/Experience ubuntu.ogg"
                ( or ) 
      -- by employing the escape character \:

        usage : ~/Examples/Experience\ ubuntu.ogg
    
```
